## swaps.sh
This was a project I created to gain experience on the flow of creating and managing swaps via third party providers. 

It's able to facilitate swaps between many different crypto pairs (i.e. BTC_ETH, XMR_BTC, XTZ_ETH) and keep track of their state by periodically checking order statuses.
